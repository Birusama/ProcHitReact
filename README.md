## Features
### Impulses
Supports Linear, Angular, and Radial impulses

Supports applying impulses to bones separate from the simulated bone

### Per-Bone Tuning
Supports disabling physics or using custom blend weights on child bones of the simulated bone

This means we can disable physics only on the arms for our character who is aiming a rifle!

### Profiles
Supports extendable profiles, simply specify the profile you want to use when triggering a Hit React

## How to Use
